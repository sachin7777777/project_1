    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these, after you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final stage is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it maye be that the leaves are all bad. You want to get to a good leaf l. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You ca backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options, if you run out of options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example</p>
    <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="">
    <ol>
        <li>Startind at root, your options are A and B. you choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. you choose C</li><br>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Gp back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
        <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structures called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

        <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
        <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }else{
                for each childe c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
              }
            }
        </pre>
        </font>
        <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution-that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
        <h3>How does this work ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Hence to decide whether any non-waf node is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any of solvable This is done recursively, on each child of n. In tha above code, this is done by the lines</p>
        <font color="blue">
        <pre>for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds, return tours
        }
        return false
        </pre>
        </font>
        <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. if the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. this is our base case. in the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
        <font color="blue">
        <pre>
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }
        </pre>
        </font>
        <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple bu important. you should understand it thoroughly. another way of starting it is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>To search a tree</h4></li>
            <ol>
                <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, search the substrees until you find ojne containing a goal node, or until you have <br> searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithm are translated into machine or assembly language</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            boolean solve(Node n){
                put node n on the stack;
                 while the stack is not empty{
                    if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                        if it is a goal node, return true
                        else pop it off the stack
                    }
                    else{
                        if the node at top of the stack has untried child
                         push the next untried child onto the stack
                        else pop the node off the stack

                    }
                    return false
            }
        </pre>
        <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the ork, and these are only pushed on one child at a time, hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the trem Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem</p>
        <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successtuly, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order a path from the root to a goat node</p>
        <p> Similarly when the recursive algorithm finds a geal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of curve calls. Thus as the reculsion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current levit, of storing it in an array</p>
        <p> Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm. modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path</p>
        
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            boolean solve(Noden){
                if n is a leaf node{
                     if the leaf is a goal node{
                    print n
                    return true
                }
                 else return false
            }else{
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds{
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                }
                return false
            }
          }
        </pre>
        <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
        <p>all of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty buttered up with detairs Even determining whether the mode is a leaf can be complex:</p>
        <p>for example, the path represents a series of moves in a chess enggame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions</p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests the this should be buned in methods in a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by <b>writing a gameOver method</b> (or you could even call itLeaf). This method would encapsulate all the up gerais of figuring out whether any possible moves remain</p>
        <p>Notice that the backtracking allorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been red aready so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made tres look simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n.</b> in reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children am, and there may be no obvious way to step through them in chess, for example a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can epresent the arrangement alter some prece has made a legal move How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examamined</p>
        <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which enten of the node nave Deen red is as fonows: Upon initial entry to the that is when you first get them from above make a bit of all its children As you try each child, take it off the ist When empty there are no temaining untried children, and you can return failure This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work</p>
        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which chidren have been trea, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next</p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already thed children through <b>K-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through n. Or, if you alid trying to color a thap with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> Il child yellow falls. you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze you can try choices in the order left, straight, night <b>(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b></p>
        <p>it isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node <b>in the chess game example,</b> you might number your preces lo purhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numenical order; but in addition each piece may also have several ve and these must also be ordered</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the umolest kind of free, a binary tree</p>
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (paint torp, one or two other nodes which are called its children The chadien are referred to as the left child and/or the right chid A notes are reachable (oy one or more steps) from the soot node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not er of the deftion of a binary tree, we will say that a node might of might not be a goal node and will contain its name. The Fit example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree</p>
        <p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            public class BinaryTree{
                BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                boolean isGoalNode = false;
                String name;

                BinaryTree(StringTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode){
                    this.name = name;
                    leftChild = left;
                    rightChild = right;
                    this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <p>Next we will create a treeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            static BinaryTree makeTree(){
                BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
                c= new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
                d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
                e = new Binarytree("E", null, null, true);
                f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
                a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
                b = new Binarytree("B", e, f, false);
                return root; 
            }
        </pre>
        <p>here's main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
                /*1*/ if(node == null) return false;
                /*2*/ if(node.isGoalNode) return true;
                /*3*/ if(solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                /*4*/ if(solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                /*5*/ return false;
                }
        </pre>
        <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>if we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node first checking whether those children actually exist</li>
            <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success</li>
            <li>See if the felt coia of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non- and is not a goal node, says to</li>
            <li>Do the same thing for the right child</li>
            <li>Since neither child of node is salvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening resuit true.</p>
        <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null in the above we put that check as the first thing in solvatio alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do Here's that alternative version;</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            static boolean solvable (BinaryTree node) {
                if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
        <p> I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>What are the children?</h2>
        <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next, as far as you know both the left and ine night child are possible solutions in many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate chiaren immediately, without recursion.</p>
        <p>Consider for example, the problem of four-coloring a map it is a theorem of mathemates that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color</p>
        <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored</p>
        <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
           <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur if and when you run bu countries, you have successfully colored the map</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard This should be easily solvable: after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
        <b>boolean mapisOKO)</b>
        <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly</p>
        <p><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b></p>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the green color</p>
        <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
                if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapisOK();
                map[row][column] = color:
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                    Int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                    if (explore1[next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
        <p>And here's rhe code for method 2:</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
                if (row>= NUM_ROWS)return true;
                if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
                 map[row][column] = color;
                 for (int nextColor= RED; nextColor < BLUE; nextColor++) {
                  int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                  if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor]) return true;
                 }
                }
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
        <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing the timing information suggest othereise</p>

        <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to meature dess than 1 milisecond). Why the huge difference? heur these methods could have exponential growth Eliminating a node automatically eliminates al of its descendents and my w often prevent exponential growth Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>
        <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These ticks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines</p>
        <b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b>
        <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method can and retum lor at rast the mass important ones! You drooby want to print for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with However if you just pet along ist of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
        <b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b>
        <p>Dent clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purousshelf coola in bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, 19 in very careful with it.</p>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. for this trival program, there,s almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>

        <h2>Trick#3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h2>
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working why throw this code away?</p>
        <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit for to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of werk What's more, in the above example you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every returnino(node)) with return false With all thes changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program</p>
        <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional For example,</p>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            static final boolean debugging = false;


            static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                if(debugging){
                    System.out.printnondent "Entering solvable!" + name(node) + ")").
                    indent-indent+"|";
                }
            }
            
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging)(
                    indent-indent substring(3):
                    System.out.print(indent "solvable namelnode)") retums true
            }
            return true
        }
        
        static boolean no(Binary Tree node) {
            if (debugging)
             indent = Indent substring(3)
             System.out.printinindent-"solvable+namen(node)) returns false");
        }
        return false;
    }
        </pre>
        <P>in industry, actual programs often have multiple tags to control different aspects of debugging Don't worry too much ab making your code larger, modern compilers wil notice that since the variable debugging is final it can never be true and e controlled code will be discarded.</p>
            <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
            <p>if an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message pintStackTrace(PrintStream): Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions: However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it For example, the foo code</p>
            <p style="color: blue;">new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie.printStackTrace(System.out);</p>
            <p>will print out a thessage something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That the above code just acts la print statement.</p>

            <p>Each passible move will result in new boat peilion and these new bond positions are the chidren of the coment bod position Hence to find the children of a node that is, of a board poution we need only find the possite moves from that node Remember that it is also highly deurable to Sed an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
            <p>Here it id time to stop and take thought To make progress we must analyze the game to some extent Probably a number approaches would work, and what low based on the way worked it out if you were to program timp you might fina a different but equally valid approach.</p>
            <p>First notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unque it it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump it it can jump cannot move ahead one squate This suggests that a field the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the martes and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles we have looked at at the possible moves This would require hasing a table to keep track of where each marble or wise somehow marking each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the hurdle we want Neither alternative very attractive</p>
            <p>Next notice that for given board position, each marble occupies a unique space Hence, instead of talking about moving a particule marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space if a move is possible from a given space then that must be the only main pouble from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique Theres a light cotiation because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (ie the marbles) stay in one place</p>
            <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>if the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
                <li>if the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right</li>
                <li>if the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We write another method <b>int[ ] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position make a mow from eta position, and return as its value a new board. We could ente this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board ather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity in technical jargon, make Move is applicative rather than "mutative";</p>

            <p>Notice that the solutions is given in reverse orden: Black starts out on the left and white on the right, as in the last line. I have added line numbers to the actual outpost in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces it's result (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reserve the results again to get them in the correct order.</p>
